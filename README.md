Source code for my personal website, www.uwk348li.com/

Currently very rough, but the structure is developed enough to allow for content to be added.

TODO (in order of highest to lowest priority):
- Add HTTPS
- Fill project page with content
- Fill about page with content
- Improve UX for blog page
- Start writing content for blog
- Freshen up the aesthetics
- Write program or add page to streamline blog creation
